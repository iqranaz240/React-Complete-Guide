MUST READ: Redux createStore() is (not) deprecated
In the next lectures, you'll learn about Redux and how to use it. As part of these lectures a so-called Redux store will be created with help of a function called createStore().

When using that function in your code, you might get a deprecation warning by your IDE or when running the app.

You should ignore this warning!

You can still use createStore() without issues.

Indeed, the React Redux team now recommends the usage of an extra package called Redux Toolkit and another way of creating the Redux store. That package will indeed be covered a little bit later in the course as well. But by first diving into createStore() and the next lectures, you'll learn how Redux works and what it does. This is some crucial knowledge that's required no matter if you're then using Redux Toolkit (as mentioned: Covered later as well) or not!
